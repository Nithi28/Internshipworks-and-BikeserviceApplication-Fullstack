CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}



You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="center">This heading will not be affected</h1>
<p class="center">This paragraph will be red and center-aligned.</p> 

</body>
</html>

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>



The CSS Universal Selector:
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}


The CSS Grouping Selector:
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

Example
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}









CSS Combinators:

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 

Example
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


Child Selector (>)
The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

Example
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

Example
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}



General Sibling Selector (~)
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

Example
div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
