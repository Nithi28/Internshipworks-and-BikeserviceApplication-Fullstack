            There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they-
When the dark of the night comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive, lookin' for somethin' wild
Now-now we lookin' like pimps in my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight, I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a-
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
</p>
<p class="even">
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down 'til the sun comes back around
Now-now we gettin' so smashed, knockin' over trash cans
Everybody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy, hot mess
And I'm down to get faded
</p>
<p class="odd">
I'm not the designated driver, so I don't give a
I don't give a, I don't give a-
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Everybody take it off
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
</p>
<p class="even">
Everybody take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Everybody take it off
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
